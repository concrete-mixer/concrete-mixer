# bpm (beats per minute)

# Chuck samplerate parameter
# If you're having problems with performance you can adjust to 32000 without

# Concrete mixer has the concept of streams - directories of sound files of a
# particular kind. Having multiple streams allows a more even mix, for example
# one stream could play background ambient sounds while another stream might
# contain musical sounds. If these sounds were all in a single stream you might
# have multiple musical sounds clashing with each other, or multiple background
# sounds providing little aural focus. Separating kinds of sounds into their own
# streams ensures the mix is more even.
#
# You can define as many streams as you like, or just one. The convention for
# a stream setting is stream<number>Path. There is no limit to the number of
# streams save for CPU and sense.
#
# Conventions: soundcloud playlists are denoted by stream<N>Url (where <N> is a
# number. Directories are denoted by stream<N>path.
